# Hotel Analytics Dashboard Project

I am thrilled to share my latest Power BI project: **the Hotel Analytics Dashboard**!

In today's hospitality industry, understanding key metrics such as **Revenue**, **Occupancy %**, **Average Rating**, and more is paramount for driving success. Utilizing Power BI, I meticulously crafted a dynamic dashboard that visualizes these metrics in a user-friendly interface.

## Key Insights:

### Revenue Management Optimization:

By analyzing Total Bookings, Occupancy %, and Revenue WoW Change %, I identified trends and patterns crucial for strategic decision-making in revenue management.

### Platform Performance Evaluation:

Analyzing Booking % by Platform provided insights into the effectiveness of various booking platforms, enabling targeted marketing efforts and partnerships with high-performing platforms.

### Customer Experience Enhancement:

Leveraging Average Rating and Realization %, I identified areas for improvement in guest satisfaction and service delivery, allowing for the implementation of targeted initiatives to enhance the overall guest experience.

### Market Trends Analysis:

Monitoring metrics such as ADR WoW Change % (Average Daily Rate) and RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) facilitated a deeper understanding of market dynamics and competitor performance, enabling informed decision-making.

This hotel analytics dashboard provides valuable insights that can assist in making data-driven decisions, optimizing operations, and enhancing guest experiences.
